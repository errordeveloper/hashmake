# A Hack to Make 'make' Work Better!

 The idea is to check upon whether contents
 of a file and the compilation flags has
 changed from one run to another.

 It appear to be not too difficult to do in
 a simple makefile, rather then trying to
 reinvent the wheel in a different language!

## Notes:

 So far it's a very immature project, but
 once I'm done with the testing I hope it
 will be usefull to many users!

 I need to consider renaming it, perhaps,
 because there exists a command in Solaris
 with the same name. However this is not a
 commad, but only a makefile template. Of
 course it may be turned into one somewhat.
